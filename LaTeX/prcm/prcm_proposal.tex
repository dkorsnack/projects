Below is a proposal for several consulting projects that span the functional
areas of the PRCM investment process. The below information is a collection of
personal assessments after a one day on-site visit and discussions with several
members of the team. As a caveat, all project completion times are (conservative)
estimates, and some of the proposals may not be deemed a priority or may have
already begun and/or been completed. \\

Page one describes short-term projects that could be completed over the
next few months adding value to the investment process relatively quickly; page
two lists medium- and long-term projects (enabled by the short-term work) that
would require further discussions and a renegotiated arrangement which we can
discuss at a later date. \\
