\textbf{About Me} \\
Two years ago, I moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child, leaving behind two quantitative investment firms which I
helped build from scratch -- Potaums Trading LLC, a SEC Registered Broker Dealer
and PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered Investment Advisor. In the meantime, I have
helped a large Family Office automate and systematize the investment process for
the liquid portion of their portfolio. I have spent the past fifteen years at the
crossroads of technology, finance (corporate and investment), and operations.

I am an entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and 
meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
using technology to automate and create efficiencies to streamline complicated
processes. I enjoy math, programming, and solving complex problems navigating large
data sets. I have hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale
production systems that have added value across the Finance investment process
including trading, operations, portfolio management, and research.

\textbf{Why Weedmaps?} \\
I believe strongly in a data-driven approach to improving business processes, 
and my philosophy is agnostic to any one particular field of study, whether that be providing
technology and software infrastructure to the asset management or cannabis industry.
As long as there are complex, "big-data" sets that needs to be studied via statistical
inference, then I'll be intellectually satisfied. Even if some numbers don't have
currency symbols in front of them, it seems this is the exact opportunity that
Weedmaps has to offer.
 
In my humble opinion, the cannabis industry is poised for extreme growth over
the next decade, and I see Weedmaps as very well positioned to capitalize / monetize
such acceleration. Lastly, as I moved to CA for a work-life balance, I'm impressed
by the employee benefits package Weedmaps provides. 

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over my Finance career, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing disruptive technologies to gain a competitive edge in the
financial industry. I am comfortable working in Linux, Macintosh, and Windows
environments -- and although I prefer Linux -- I consider myself a
``Microsoft Office Power User". I have programming
experience in several languages including Python, Java, \& VBA and spend most of 
my time digging into cloud-based causal, relational SQL databases. I have successfully
managed relationships with technical engineers to produce top-tier applications
for traders, portfolio managers, and operational staff. Given the opportunity, I
humbly believe my prior financial/technology experience, collaborative nature,
and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable member of the Weedmaps
Finance, Strategy \& Operations/Analytics Teams. \\
