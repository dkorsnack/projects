\textbf{About Me} \\
Three years ago, I moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to build a family
after the birth of my first child, leaving behind two quantitative investment
firms which I helped build from scratch: 1) PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered
Investment Advisor and 2) Potamus Trading LLC, a SEC Registered
Broker Dealer.

Currently, I manage the publicly-traded portfolio of a large Family
Office to help it meet its financial goals. I've been systematically trading
and researching the public, electronically exchange-traded markets for the
past tweleve years. At the moment, I'm working on several projects:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Trading}: Commission Reduction; Slippage Reduction (Algorithmic Execution); Trade Allocation 
  \item \textit{Portfolio Managment}: Harvesting real-time diversification; Incorporating AI/ML Risk Management techniques
  \item \textit{Research}: Portfolio Back- and Stress-Testing; Expansion into additional risk-premia
  \item \textit{Operations}: Pre- and Post-Trade Reporting; Automation of Settlement, Custody, \& Clearing %via broker specific APIs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why AlphaCore?} \\
My prior firm was approached by a large Robo-Advisor as a solution
for it's clients. Since then, I have been interested in Wealth Management. Unfortunately,
most investment advisors (especially robotic ones) deliver one-size-fits-all
solutions for clients, which, in my humble opinion, is not the most beneficial
approach. Currently working for a Family Office, I am more aware than ever that investments are
just the foundation of a portfolio and should be integrated into and evaluated
as part of the big picture. Successfully managing wealth is not all about finding
the best investment or building the optimal portfolio; it is more about taking a
360$^{\circ}$ view and considering all of the client's finances (taxes, retirement,
college/estate planning, insurance, charitable giving, etc.) then constructing
holistic portfolios that ensure the client meets their financial goals. In summary,
I resonate with AlphaCore's Vision and want to work for a a firm operating under the
fiduciary standard where the client's interest is, by design, paramount.

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
both raising assets and managing them effectively. I've been on the front-facing
side of the business and have built deep client relationships; also, I've utilized
technology to automate, manage, and improve the investment process wherever
possible. I am confident my prior ``Fin-Tech" experience would seamlessly 
transition to the wealth management business, and I am confident that my collaborative
nature and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable Trading/Investment Analyst
for the AlphaCore team.
