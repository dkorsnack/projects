\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
systematic approaches to investment, and fully appreciate the ``mission critical"
role that data and automation play in quantitative finance. I enjoy math, programming,
and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience designing, building,
and maintaining large-scale production systems that have added value across the
investment process including research, portfolio management, execution,
and operations. 

\textbf{Why TGS?} \\
I have always believed in applying the scientific method to investing, and I
resonate with TGS' ability to combine engineering, technology, and academic
rigor to solve complex financial problems to achieve their investors goals.
As a newcomer to the area, I am delighted to see that intellectually curious,
collaborative investment firms like TGS exist in southern California. I
moved to Irvine to achieve a better work-life balance while raising my family,
and TGS' focus on community and dedication to their employees professional
and personal growth is inspiring.

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I spend most of my time in a cloud-based Linux environment writing, maintaining,
and monitoring software that acquires, curates, stores, and analyzes financial
market data. As you can see from my attached resume, I have experience dealing
with a plethora of financial data from multiple vendors:
\begin{list}{\labelitemiv}{\leftmargin=1em}
  \item ``High Frequency": real-time trade and quote data on US equity securities
  utilizing low-latency feed handlers
  \item ``Medium Frequency": aggregation of over-the-counter global FX and
  corporate bond trade and quote data from various brokers
  \item ``Low Frequency": fundamental economic, factor, and accounting data 
\end{list}
I humbly believe my experience and skill set would be a good fit for the Software
Developer role, and I am confident I could ``hit the ground running" as a productive
member of the TGS team.

  Thanks in advance for your consideration, \\
