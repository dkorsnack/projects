\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
systematic approaches to investment, and fully appreciate the mission critical
role that technology, data, and automation play in quantitative finance. I enjoy
math, programming, and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience
designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production systems that have
added value across the investment process including trading, operations,
portfolio management, and research. \\

\textbf{Why PIMCO?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, PIMCO's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that PIMCO has achieved over it's (almost) 50 year history all
while continuing to put clients first and help investors reach their
financial goals. As a newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically located
near such an intellectually curious, collaborative investment firm that I have
admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course of my career. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by PIMCO's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I am a ``self-starter" who never stops learning and experimenting; I like
breaking stuff and putting it back together. Over the past decade, I have added
value across the entire investment process for a multi-strategy portfolio that
spans all asset classes around globe utilizing disruptive technologies to gain
a competitive edge in the financial industry. I am comfortable working in 
nearly all operating systems, but spend most of my time in a cloud-based Linux
image programming in Python, SQL, and R. If given the chance, I am confident
that my prior financial/technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability
to learn quickly would make me a valuable member of the PIMCO Quant Developer team.
