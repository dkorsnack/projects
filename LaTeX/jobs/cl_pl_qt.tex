  Employment Application for Quantitative Technologist \\
  \noindent\rule[0.5ex]{\linewidth}{0.5pt}

\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I enjoy math,
programming, and utilizing technology to solve complex problems. I have hands on
experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production software
that have added value across the investment process including portfolio management,
research, trading, and operations. \\ 

\textbf{Why the Quantitative Technologist Role?} \\
Having successfully used disruptive technologies to change how
investors think about, access, and trade their capital in the financial markets,
I desire applying my knowledge and expertise to create efficiencies and streamline
complicated processes in additional industries such as insurance. I have a
decade of experience using quantitative methods to manage portfolios while
leveraging efficient software and ``big data" resources to add value in the
asset management industry. Throughout my experience I've helped build a
SEC registered Broker-Dealer and Designated Market-Maker on the NYSE
(Potamus Trading LLC) and SEC Registered Investment Adviser (PhaseCapital LP)
which have both produced compelling results for their investors. Working
for Pacific Life gives me a platform to combine my technical and quantitative
skill sets to drive improvements across the existing AQM infrastructure. \\ 

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing technology to gain a competitive edge in the financial industry.
I am a ``self-starter" who never stops learning and experimenting; I like breaking
stuff and putting it back together. I am comfortable working in Windows, Macintosh,
and Linux environments and have programming experience in several languages. Currently,
I spend most of my time in a cloud-based Linux image programming in Python, SQL,
and R searching for inefficiencies in the financial markets. If given the chance,
I am confident you will agree that my  prior financial/technology experience,
collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable
candidate for the ``Quant Tech" role. \\
