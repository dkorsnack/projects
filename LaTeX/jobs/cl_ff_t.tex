\textbf{About Me} \\
I have spent the last 12+ years trading liquid, exchange-listed
financial securities for institutional portfolios. I am an entrepreneurial, high
energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to detail.
I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build relationships
easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. Most importantly, I am passionate
about helping clients meet their financial goals. I have successfully:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built execution systems that traded an average of
    10M shares of S\&P500 securities on a given day for a SEC Registered
    Broker Dealer and Designated Market Maker on the NYSE (Potamus Trading; Boston, MA)
  \item Directed the execution of \$500M AUM in listed Equity and Derivative
    securities for a SEC Registered Investment Advisor (PhaseCapital; Boston, MA)
  \item Managed a \$100M portfolio trading liquid Futures and Options, as well
    as OTC cash instruments for a Large Single Family Office (TeeHub LLC; Irvine, CA)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why First Foundation?} \\
Trading wrap accounts for First Foundation -- an integrated, high-touch service
platform with over \$10B in total assets under management dedicated to putting the client
first -- seems a great  fit for me to apply my investment acumen and buy-side
trading experience while learning the ins and outs of the wealth management business.
Integrating traditional banking and investment advisory services is difficult, and
I admire First Foundation's 30 year track record of success, staying true to the original
Keller Group vision. 
Most investment advisors deliver ``one-size-fits-all" solutions for clients,
which, in my humble opinion, is not the most beneficial approach. Currently
working for a Family Office, I am aware that investments are just the foundation
of a portfolio and should be integrated into and evaluated as part of the 
big picture. Successfully managing wealth is not about finding the
``best investment" or building the ``optimal portfolio"; it is about considering
all of the client's finances (taxes, estate planning, insurance, charitable giving,
etc.) and constructing holistic portfolios that ensure the client meets their financial
goals. \\ 

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing technology to automate and systematize the execution of liquid financial
securities. I would like to transition my expertise in trading/execution to
the wealth management business, and I am confident that my
prior financial technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability to
learn quickly would make me a valuable Trader for the First Foundation team.

  Thanks in advance for your consideration, \\
