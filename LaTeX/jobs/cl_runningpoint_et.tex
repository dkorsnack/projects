\textbf{About Me} \\
I have spent the last 12 years trading liquid, exchange-listed
financial securities for institutional portfolios. I am an entrepreneurial, high energy candidate with a strong
work ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people from various
backgrounds, am able to build relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am
adaptable. Most importantly, I am passionate about helping my investors meet their
financial goals. I have successfully:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built execution systems that traded an average of
    10M shares of S\&P500 securities on a given day for a SEC Registered
    Broker Dealer and Designated Market Maker on the NYSE (Potamus Trading; Boston, MA)
  \item Directed the execution of \$500M AUM in listed Equity and Derivative
    securities for a SEC Registered Investment Advisor (PhaseCapital; Boston, MA)
  \item Managed a \$100M portfolio trading liquid Futures and Options
    for a Large Single Family Office (TeeHub LLC; Irvine, CA)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why Running Point Capital Advisors?} \\
Trading Equities for Running Point -- an advisor dedicated to taking ``a
$360^\circ$ view" of the financial well-being of its clients -- seems a great 
fit for me to apply my investment acumen and buy-side trading experience while
learning the ins and outs of the wealth management business.
Most investment advisors deliver ``one-size-fits-all" solutions for clients,
which, in my humble opinion, is not the most beneficial approach. Currently
working for a Family Office, I am aware that investments are just the foundation
of a portfolio and should be integrated into and evaluated as part of the 
big picture. Successfully managing wealth is not about finding the
``best investment" or building the ``optimal portfolio"; it is about considering
all of the client's finances (taxes, estate planning, insurance, charitable giving,
etc.) and constructing holistic portfolios that ensure the client meets their financial
goals. \\ 

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing technology to automate and systematize the execution of liquid financial
securities. I would like to transition my expertise in trading/execution to
the wealth management business, and I am confident that my
prior financial technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability to
learn quickly would make me a valuable Equity Trader for the Running Point team.
