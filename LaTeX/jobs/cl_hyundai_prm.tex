\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA a few years ago to be closer to
family after the birth of my identical twins, for my wife and I could not
raise our three boys -- 2yrs old and younger at the time -- without the support
of grandma and grandpa. I've been working in the capital markets for 12+ years
in multiple capacities. In Boston I assisted in the creation of Potamus Trading LLC, 
a SEC Registered Broker Dealer as well as PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered Investment
Advisor. Although different businesses, both firms operated under a ``risk-first"
mentality. I am passionate about leveraging technology, ``big-data", and Artificial
Intelligence to mitigate risk implemented via rigorous, quantitative, and systematic
processes. Currently I manage the liquid portion of a High Net Worth Individual's Single
Family Office under a similar philosophy. I am an entrepreneurial and high energy
candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work
well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build relationships easily,
am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I enjoy math, programming, and solving complex
problems. I have hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining production
systems that have systematically added value across the entire investment process
with a primary focus on portfolio / risk management. \\

\textbf{Why Hyundai Capital America (HCA)?} \\
I grew up 30 minutes outside of Detroit, MI when it was the automotive capital of
the US; I've always loved driving and working on cars. Shortly after I began risk
managing financial portfolios in 2009, General Motors filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.
It amazed me how the only real profitable part of the firm was it's financing unit.
I am extremely intellectually stimulated by Loan Servicing and humbly believe I
could ``hit the ground running" and add value quickly by implementing data driven
risk-mitigation analysis, reporting, and solutions. Having worked on a trading desk
for the past dozen years, I strive in "fast-paced, dynamic, energized, unconventional,
and collaborative" environments. Since I moved to Southern California to achieve a
better work-life balance while raising my young family, I am inspired by HCA's
focus on community, emphasis on team collaboration, and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I have experience managing people of different ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds; I
have enjoyed teaching/learning from others ever since I was Head Statistics Teaching
Assistant back in college. I have managed risk for global multi-asset portfolios across
nearly all asset classes, including Equity, Fixed Income (Rates \& Credit),
Commodities, Foreign Exchange, Derivatives, and Alternatives with a main focus
on measuring and reacting to changes in risk and risk relationships across and
within the assets in the portfolio. Risk is loosely defined and means many things
to many people. There is a nearly endless of measurements of risk across asset classes:
Realized/Implied Volatility, Correlation, Beta, Dispersion, Concentration,
Duration/Convexity, Prepayment/Default, Credit, Counterparty, Sensitivity (e.g.
``the Greeks"), Basis, Margin, VaR (and its many siblings), Liquidity, Regulatory,
etc. Personally, I like to simply define risk as ``the permanent loss of capital" for
I am a believer that``a penny saved is actually worth more than a penny earned".

\newpage

Technically,
\begin{itemize}
  \item I am comfortable working in different operating system environments such
  as Macintosh, and Linux while consider myself a Microsoft 365/Office power user
  \item I have programming experience in several languages such as Python, R, VBA
  and Java as well as shell Scripting languages such as Bash
  \item I have acquired data from multiple sources via programmable APIs from sources
  such as Bloomberg, Thompson Reuters, FactSet, TickData, and direct from Trading Exchangs
  \item I have curated, and stored dense data sets, both structured and unstructured
  via SQL and No-SQL 
\end{itemize}
Humbly, I believe my prior financial and technology experience, collaborative nature,
and ability to learn/adapt and quickly would make me a valuable Manager of Portfolio
Risk for HCA.
 
\closing{
  Thanks in advance for your consideration and I look forward to speaking further
  about the position, \\
