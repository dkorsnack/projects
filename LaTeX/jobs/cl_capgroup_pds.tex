\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child; now I have three boys under 4 years old. I currently
manage over \$100M in liquid assets for a High Net Worth individual's Family Office
in Irvine after helping create two distinct investment firms: a SEC Registered
Investment Advisor (PhaseCapital LP) and a SEC Registered Broker Dealer (Potamus
Trading LLC). I am an entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with a strong work
ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds,
am able to build relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am
passionate about leading people to achieve their full potential for I genuinely believe
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Having managed systematic
investment approaches on the buy-side for 12+ years, I appreciate the critical
role that data and automation play in quantitative finance. I enjoy math, programming,
solving complex problems, and seperating information from noisy, large data sets.
I have hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production
systems that have added value across the investment process including research,
portfolio management, execution, and operations while leading teams of finance
and technical professionals to cost effectively meet investors' goals.

\textbf{Why Capital Group?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, Capital Group's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that Capital Group and the American Funds have achieved over nearly
100 years of history all while continuing to put clients first and help investors
reach their financial objectives. (I currently hold several American Funds in my IRA.)
As a relative newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically
located near such an intellectually curious, collaborative investment firm that I have
admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course of my career. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by Capital Group's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I am a self-starter who never stops learning and experimenting;
I like breaking stuff and putting it back together. Over the past
decade, I have added value across the entire investment process for a several
portfolios that span all asset classes around the globe. I am comfortable working
in nearly all operating systems, but spend most of my time dealing with large data
sets in an AWS cloud-based Linux / RDS image programming in Python, SQL, and R
writing, maintaining, and monitoring software that acquires, curates, stores, and
analyzes financial market data utilizing AI to gain an edge
in today's extremely efficient marketplace. As you can see from my attached resume,
I have experience dealing with a plethora of financial data from multiple vendors:
\begin{list}{\labelitemiv}{\leftmargin=1em}
  \item ``High Frequency": real-time trade and quote data on Equity and Derivative
  securities utilizing low-latency feed handlers
  \item ``Medium Frequency": aggregation of over-the-counter global FX, Treasury and
  corporate bond trade and quote data from various brokers
  \item ``Low Frequency": fundamental economic, factor, and accounting data
\end{list}

\newpage

I humbly believe my experience and skill set would be a good fit for the Product \& Data
Solutions Senior Manager role, and I could ``hit the ground running"
as a productive member of the Capital Group team.
