\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a quantitative, risk-based
investment firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an
entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous
attention to detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
leveraging technology to exploit inefficiencies in the financial markets and
automate/streamline complicated processes. I enjoy math, programming, and solving
complex problems. I have hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining
large-scale production systems that have systematically added value across the
investment process including portfolio / risk management, research, trading,
and operations. \\

\textbf{Why PIMCO?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, PIMCO's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that PIMCO has achieved over it's (almost) 50 year history all
while continuing to put clients first and help investors reach their
financial goals. As a newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically located
near such an intellectually curious, collaborative investment firm that I have
admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course of my career. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by PIMCO's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing disruptive technologies to gain a competitive edge in the
financial industry. I have experience managing global multi-asset portfolios
(including Equity, Fixed Income, and Alternatives) focused on measuring and
reacting to changes in risk and risk relationships across and within asset
classes. I am comfortable working in Windows, Macintosh, and Linux environments,
consider myself a ``Microsoft Office Power User", and have programming experience
in several languages including Python, R, VBA, and SQL. I am confident that my
prior financial/technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability to
learn quickly would make me a valuable member of the PIMCO Portfolio Associate
team.
