\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child and recent addition of identical twins. I've been managing
risk at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment firm I helped build from the
ground up, for a decade. I am an entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with
a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people
from various backgrounds, am able to build relationships easily, am eager to learn,
and am adaptable.

I am passionate about using technology to improve our daily lives and have enjoyed
participating in the recent disruption of the traditional financial industry.
I enjoy math, programming, and solving complex problems. I have designed, built,
and maintained large-scale production systems that have added value across the
entire investment process including portfolio/risk management, trading, research,
and operations. As a Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and active member of the Global
Association of Risk Professionals (GARP), I think and invest with a ``risk-first"
mentality and have produced an excellent track record managing money at low cost
for both institutional and retail clients. 

\textbf{Why Acorns?} \\
I am a big believer in Acorn's mission, considering I have built my professional
career helping investors meet their financial goals. As a relatively new father,
I have pondered how to introduce my children to the concept of saving for their
future. Acorns provides an elegant solution that helps simplify the overwhelming
landscape of investing. It would be an honor to help Acorns continue to
revolutionize the investment landscape and assist the company in providing
investors access to low-fee, well-diversified portfolios with a micro sized
investment.

As a newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically located
near such a creative, collaborative financial-technology firm with over
\$1 Billion in the future generations' wealth to look after. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by Acorn's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth.

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I have experience utilizing technology to manage risk for global multi-asset
portfolios (including Equity, Fixed Income, and Alternatives) primarily by
measuring and tactically reacting to changes in risk and risk relationships
across and within asset classes. I am comfortable leading a team of investment
professionals and enjoy ``getting my hands dirty" from a technical perspective.
I am confident that my prior financial/technology experience, collaborative
nature, and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable addition to the
Acorn Risk Management team. \\
