\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA a few years ago to be closer to
family after the birth of my identical twins, for my wife and I could not
raise our three boys (2yrs old and younger at the time) without the support
of Grandma and Grandpa. I've been working in the capital markets for 12+ years
in multiple capacities. In Boston I assisted in the creation of Potamus Trading LLC, 
a SEC Registered Broker Dealer as well as PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered Investment
Advisor. Although different businesses, both firms operated under a ``risk-first",
mentality looking to leverage technology, ``big-data", and Artificial Intelligence
to provide attractive alternative risk-adjusted-returns for our investors via
quantitative and systematic investment processes. Currently I help manage the liquid
portion of a High Net Worth Individual's Single Family Office under the same
philosophy. I am an entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with a strong work
ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people from various
backgrounds, am able to build relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am
adaptable. I enjoy math, programming, and solving complex problems. I have hands
on experience designing, building, and maintaining production systems that have
systematically added value across the entire investment process including portfolio/
risk management, research, trading, and operations. \\

\textbf{Why PIMCO?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$1.5 Trillion in assets under
management, PIMCO's track record speaks for itself. Even more impressive, according
to Pensions \& Investments, PIMCO saw net inflows of ~1\% in 2020 -- a period of
all time lows in yields across the globe as well as a global pandemic reeking havoc
on the economy. I have admired the consistent success that PIMCO has achieved over
its near 50 year history as the firm continues to put clients first while helping
investors reach their financial goals. As a relative newcomer to the area, I am
lucky to be physically located near such an intellectually curious, collaborative
investment firm that I have admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course
of my career. Since I moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life
balance while raising my young family, I am inspired by PIMCO's focus on community
and dedication to their employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I have over a decade of experience dealing with alternative investment strategies
embracing disruptive technologies to mitigate risk, exploit inefficiencies, and gain
a competitive edge in the in the financial industry.
I've assisted in managing low latency statistical arbitrage trading systems seeking
consistent, uncorrelated, high Sharpe Ratio alpha returns as well as global multi-asset
portfolios to efficiently harvest beta by providing ``dynamic diversification" by
measuring and reacting to changes in risk and risk relationships across and within
the assets in the portfolio. I have knowledge of nearly all asset classes, including
Equity, Fixed Income, Commodities, Foreign Exchange, Derivatives, and Alternatives.
I enjoy math, programming, automating/streamlining complicated processes, and
solving complex problems. I have hands on
experience designing, building, and maintaining production systems that systematically
added value across the investment process including trading, operations, portfolio
management, and research. 

\newpage

I am comfortable working in
Windows, Macintosh, and Linux environments, consider myself a ``Microsoft Office
Power User", and have programming experience in several languages including Python,
VBA, R, as well as extensive database knowledge storing both structured (SQL)
and unstructured (No-SQL) causal data sets. I am confident that my prior financial/
technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would
make me a valuable member of the PIMCO Hedge Fund / Absolute Return team. \\
