\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
systematic approaches to investment, and enjoy math, programming, and solving
complex problems. I have hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining
large-scale production systems that have added value across the investment process
including research, portfolio management, execution, and operations.

\textbf{Why Strategic Global Advisors?} \\
I have always believed in applying the scientific method to investing, and I
resonate with SGA's ability to combine unbiased, systematic tools with
qualitative, traditional analysis and active risk management to achieve their
investors goals. As a newcomer to the area, it is refreshing to see firms like
SGA exist in Southern California. Having built a global long-only, multi-asset
firm from scratch, I'm delighted to be close by to institutional asset management
firms that follow similar principles to deliver investors improved risk-adjusted
returns via a disciplined investment process.

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I am comfortable working in nearly all operating systems, but currently
spend most of my time in a cloud based Linux image writing, maintaining, and monitoring
software in Python, SQL, and R. As you can see from my attached resume, I have
a decade of experience:

\begin{list}{\labelitemiv}{\leftmargin=1em}
  \item acquiring, curating, storing, and analyzing a plethora of financial
    ``big data" from multiple vendors
  \item applying statistical, quantitative, and machine learning techniques to
    improve traditional financial models
  \item valuing securities and exploiting opportunities in the capital
    markets via efficient execution algorithms 
\end{list}

I humbly believe my skill set would be a good fit for the Quantitative Developer
role, and if given the chance, I am confident that my prior financial/technology
experience, collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would make me a
valuable member of the SGA team.

  Thanks in advance for your consideration, \\
