\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
systematic approaches to investment, and fully appreciate the critical
role that data and automation play in quantitative finance. I enjoy math, programming,
and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience designing, building,
and maintaining large-scale production systems that have added value across the
investment process including research, portfolio management, execution, and operations.

\textbf{Why Capital Group?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, Capital Group's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that Capital and American Funds have achieved over nearly
100 years of history all while continuing to put clients first and help investors
reach their financial goals. As a newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically
located near such an intellectually curious, collaborative investment firm that I have
admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course of my career. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by Capital's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I believe in using technology to improve quality of life, and I've spent many
years avoiding redundant tasks under the philosophy ``if it needs to be done more
than once, then automate it". I am a self-starter who never stops learning and
experimenting; I like breaking stuff and putting it back together. Over the past
decade, I have added value across the entire investment process for a multi-strategy
portfolio that spans all asset classes around the globe. As a result, I am
comfortable working in nearly all operating systems, but spend most of my time in
an AWS cloud-based Linux / RDS image programming in Python, SQL, and R.
If given the chance, I am confident you will agree that my prior financial and
technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would
make me a valuable member of the Capital Group automation team.
