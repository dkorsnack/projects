\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA a few years ago to be closer to
family after the birth of my identical twins, leaving my wife with three boys
2yrs old and younger. I've been working in the capital markets for 12+ years
in multiple capacities. In Boston I assisted in the creation of Potamus Trading LLC, 
a SEC Registered Broker Dealer as well as PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered Investment
Advisor. Although different businesses, both firms operated under risk-first,
quantitative and systematic investment process. Currently I manage the liquid
portion of a High Net Worth Individual's Single Family Office under the same
philosophy. I am an entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with a strong work
ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people from various
backgrounds, am able to build relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am
adaptable. I am passionate about leveraging technology, ``big-data", and Artificial
Intelligence to assist my clients preserve their capital, exploit inefficiencies in
the capital markets, and automate/streamline complicated processes. I enjoy math,
programming, and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience designing,
building, and maintaining production systems that have systematically added value
across the entire investment process including portfolio / risk management, research,
trading, and operations. \\

\textbf{Why PIMCO?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$1.5 Trillion in assets under
management, PIMCO's track record speaks for itself. Even more impressive, (according
to Pensions \& Investments), there were net inflows of ~1\% during a period of
all time lows in yields across the globe as well as a global pandemic reeking havoc
on the economy. I have admired the consistent success that PIMCO has achieved over
its (almost) 50 year history as the firm continues to put clients first while helping
investors reach their financial goals. As a relative newcomer to the area, I am
lucky to be physically located near such an intellectually curious, collaborative
investment firm that I have admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course
of my career. Since I moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life
balance while raising my young family, I am inspired by PIMCO's focus on community
and dedication to their employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I have experience managing global multi-asset portfolios, including nearly all
asset classes, including Equity, Fixed Income, Commodities, Foreign Exchange, 
Derivatives, and Alternatives) with a main focus on measuring and
reacting to changes in risk and risk relationships across and within the
assets in the portfolio. Risk is loosely defined and means many things to many people.
There is a nearly endless of measurements of risk across asset classes; a few examples:
Realized/Implied Volatility, Correlation, Beta, Dispersion, Concentration,
Duration/Convexity, Prepayment/Default, Credit, Counterparty, Sensitivity (e.g.
``the Greeks"), Basis, Margin, VaR (and its many siblings), Liquidity, Regulatory,
etc. Personally, I like to simply define risk as ``the permanent loss of capital" for
I am a believer that``a penny saved is actually worth more than a penny earned".

\newpage

Technically,
\begin{itemize}
  \item I am comfortable working in different operating system environments such
  as Macintosh, and Linux while consider myself a Microsoft 365/Office power user
  \item I have programming experience in several languages such as Python, R, VBA
  and Java as well as shell Scripting languages such as Bash
  \item I have built, managed, and maintained project \& process management as well
  as user interface software via open source resources
  \item I have acquired data from multiple sources via programmable APIs from sources
  such as Bloomberg, Thompson Reuters, FactSet, TickData, and direct from Trading Exchangs
  \item I have curated, and stored dense data sets, both structured and unstructured
  via SQL and No-SQL 
\end{itemize}
Humbly, I believe my prior financial and technology experience, collaborative nature,
and ability to learn/adapt and quickly would make me a valuable member of the PIMCO
Portfolio Risk Management team.
 
\closing{
  Thanks in advance for your consideration and I look forward to speaking further
  about the position, \\
