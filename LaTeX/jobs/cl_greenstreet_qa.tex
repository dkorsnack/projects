\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I  enjoy
math, programming, and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience
designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production systems that have
added value across the investment process including trading, operations,
portfolio management, and research. \\

\textbf{Why Green Street Advisors?} \\
As a industry leader in real estate research for over thirty years, Green Street
Advisors' track record speaks for itself. I have been interested in utilizing
my quantitative financial/technology skill set researching the real-estate
industry -- specifically publically traded REIT securties -- and Green Street
is extremely well positioned in the industry. As a newcomer to the area, I
am thankful to be physically located near near such an intellectually curious,
collaborative advisory firm. Since I moved to Southern California to achieve a
better work-life balance while raising my family, I am inspired by the Green
Street culture and dedication to their employees professional and personal
growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I spend most of my time in a cloud-based Linux environment writing, maintaining,
and monitoring software that acquires, curates, stores, and analyzes financial
market data. I am comfortable working in almost all operating systems, but prefer
programming in Python, SQL, and R. As you can see from my attached resume, I have
experience dealing with a plethora of large financial data sets from multiple
vendors:
\begin{list}{\labelitemiv}{\leftmargin=1em}
  \item ``High Frequency": real-time trade and quote data on US equity securities
  utilizing low-latency feed handlers
  \item ``Medium Frequency": aggregation of over-the-counter global FX and
  corporate bond trade and quote data from various brokers
  \item ``Low Frequency": fundamental economic, factor, and accounting data
\end{list}
Over the past decade, I have added value across the investment process
for a multi-strategy portfolio that spans all asset classes around globe
utilizing quantitative techniques and disruptive technologies to gain
a competitive edge in the financial industry. If given the chance, I am confident
that my prior financial/technology experience, collaborative nature, and ability
to learn quickly would make me a valuable contributor to the Green Street Credit
Analytics Platform.
