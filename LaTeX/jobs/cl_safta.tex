  Transaction Dispute \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Date of Transaction: 2020-04-27 \\
  \item Dollar Amount: \$90 \\
  \item Description: \\
      A company by the name ``Wish" charged my card seven times on
      2020-04-27 without my authorization and without a purchase
      or receipt of anything whatsoever. They did refund me for two out of the seven
      charges; however, the remaing five charges have yet to be refunded.
      I have attempted to call the company several times and have emailed
      their customer service with no success. That leaves me with this final
      option: reaching out to you for a dispute.
\end{itemize}

Thanks for all of your help. Hoping for a fast response from you, \\
