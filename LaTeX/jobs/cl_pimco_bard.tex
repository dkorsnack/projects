\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
systematic approaches to investment, and fully appreciate the ``mission critical"
role that data and automation play in quantitative finance. I enjoy math, programming,
and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience working with dense 
financial data sets used to  design, build, and maintain large-scale production systems
that have added value across the investment process including research, portfolio
management, execution, and operations.

\textbf{Why PIMCO?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, PIMCO's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that PIMCO has achieved over it's (almost) 50 year history all
while continuing to put clients first and help investors reach their
financial goals. As a newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically located
near such an intellectually curious, collaborative investment firm that I have
admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course of my career. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by PIMCO's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth.

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Although I am comfortable working in nearly all operating systems, and consider
myself a ``Microsoft Office Power User", I recently spend most of my time
in a Linux environment writing, maintaining, and monitoring software that acquires,
curates, stores, and analyzes a wide-range of financial market data. As you can
see from my attached resume, I have experience dealing with a plethora of both
fundamental and technical data sets from multiple vendors:
\begin{list}{\labelitemiv}{\leftmargin=1em}
  \item ``High Frequency": real-time trade and quote data on US equity securities
  utilizing low-latency feed handlers
  \item ``Medium Frequency": aggregation of over-the-counter global FX and
  corporate bond trade and quote data from various brokers
  \item ``Low Frequency": fundamental economic, factor, and accounting data
\end{list}
I humbly believe my skill set would be a great fit for the Business Analyst position,
and I am confident I could quickly add value as a productive member of the PIMCO
Reference Data Technology team.
