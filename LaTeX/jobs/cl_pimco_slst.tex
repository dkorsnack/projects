\textbf{About Me} \\
Two years ago, I moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child, leaving behind two quantitative investment firms which I
helped build from scratch -- Potaums Trading LLC, a SEC Registered Broker Dealer
and PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered Investment Advisor. In the meantime, I have
helped a large Family Office automate and systematize the investment process for
the liquid portion of their portfolio. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
using technology to automate and create efficiencies to streamline complicated
processes. I enjoy math, programming, and solving complex problems. I have
hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production
systems that have added value across the investment process including trading,
operations, portfolio management, and research. \\

\textbf{Why PIMCO?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, PIMCO's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that PIMCO has achieved over it's ~50 year history all
while continuing to put clients first and help investors reach their
financial goals. I am lucky to be physically located near such an intellectually
curious, collaborative investment firm that I have admired from nearly 3,000 miles
away over the course of my career. Since I moved to Southern California to achieve
a better work-life balance while raising my family, I am inspired by PIMCO's focus
on community and dedication to their employees professional and personal growth. 
Lastly, I resonate with Manny Roman's vision for the firm, and would be excited
to help PIMCO diversify outside of Fixed Income into Alternatives embracing
technology along the way to achieve his objectives and do what is best for clients. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over my 12+ year career, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing disruptive technologies to gain a competitive edge in the
financial industry. I am comfortable working in Windows, Macintosh, and Linux
environments, consider myself a ``Microsoft Office Power User", and have programming
experience in several languages including VBA, Python, and SQL. I have successfully
managed relationships with technical engineers to produce top-tier applications
for traders, portfolio managers, and operational staff. Given the opportunity, I
humbly believe my prior financial/technology experience, collaborative nature,
and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable member of the PIMCO Information
Technology Business Analyst / Project Manager team. \\
