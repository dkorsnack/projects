\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child; now I have three boys under 4 years old. I currently
manage over \$100M in liquid assets for a High Net Worth individual's Family Office
in Irvine after helping create two distinct investment firms: PhaseCapital LP,
a SEC Registered Investment Advisor, and Potamus Trading LLC, a SEC Registered
Broker Dealer. I am an entrepreneurial and high energy candidate with a strong work
ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds,
am able to build relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable.
Having managed systematic investment approaches on the buy-side for 12+ years, I
appreciate the critical role that data and automation play in quantitative finance.
I enjoy math, programming, solving complex problems, and seperating information from
noisy, large data sets for easy digestion by team members and superiors vi automated
reporting (primarily via Tableau and \LaTeX) to improve decision making.
I have hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production
systems / databases that have added value across the investment process including research,
portfolio management, execution, and operations while leading/working with teams
of finance and technical professionals to cost effectively meet investors' goals. \\

\textbf{Why Capital Group?} \\
As a global leader in investment management with nearly \$2 Trillion in assets under
management, Capital Group's track record speaks for itself. I have admired the
consistent success that Capital Group and the American Funds have achieved over nearly
100 years of history all while continuing to put clients first and help investors
reach their financial objectives. (I currently hold several American Funds in my IRA.)
As a relative newcomer to the area, I am lucky to be physically
located near such an intellectually curious, collaborative investment firm that I have
admired from nearly 3,000 miles away over the course of my career. Since I
moved to Southern California to achieve a better work-life balance while raising
my family, I am inspired by Capital Group's focus on community and dedication to their
employees professional and personal growth. \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I am a self-starter who never stops learning and experimenting;
I like breaking stuff and putting it back together. Over the past
decade, I have added value across the entire investment process for a several
portfolios that span all asset classes around the globe. I have dealt with the
acquisition, curation, and efficient storage of data for nearly all asset classes,
including Equity, Fixed Income, Commodities, Foreign Exchange, Derivatives, and
Alternatives. I am comfortable working in nearly all operating systems, but currently
spend most of my time dealing with tick-level ``big data" sets in an AWS cloud-based
Linux / RDS image programming in Python, SQL, and R. As you can see from my attached resume,
I have experience dealing with a plethora of financial data from multiple vendors: \\

\newpage

\begin{list}{\labelitemiv}{\leftmargin=1em}
  \item ``High Frequency": real-time trade and quote data on Equity and Derivative
  securities utilizing low-latency feed handlers and APIs
  \item ``Medium Frequency": aggregation of over-the-counter global FX, Treasury and
  corporate bond trade and quote data from various brokers
  \item ``Low Frequency": fundamental economic, factor, and accounting data from
  from FRED, FactSet, etc.
\end{list}

I humbly believe my experience and skill set would be a good fit for the Senior
Data Quality Analyst role, and I could ``hit the ground running"
as a productive member of the Capital Group team.

  Thanks in advance for your consideration, \\
