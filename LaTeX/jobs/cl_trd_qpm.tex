  Job application for Quantitative Portfolio Manager \\
  \noindent\rule[0.5ex]{\linewidth}{0.5pt}
}

\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
using technology to exploit efficiencies in the financial markets. I enjoy math,
programming, and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience designing,
building, and maintaining large-scale production systems that have added value
across the investment process including portfolio management, trading, research,
and operations. \\ 

\textbf{Why the Quantitative Portfolio Manager Role?} \\
I have always believed in applying the scientific method to investing, and I
resonate with the usage of quantitative, systematic, and liquid strategies to
harvest alpha for investors. I have a decade of experience using quantitative
methods to manage portfolios while leveraging recent technologies to disrupt
the asset management industry. Throughout my experience I've helped build a
SEC registered broker-dealer and designated market-maker on the NYSE
(Potamus Trading LLC) and SEC registered investment advisor (PhaseCapital LP)
which have both produced compelling results for their investors. \\ 

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing technology to gain a competitive edge in the financial industry.
I am a ``self-starter" who never stops learning and experimenting; I like breaking
stuff and putting it back together. I am comfortable working in Windows, Macintosh,
and Linux environments and have programming experience in several languages. Currently,
I spend most of my time in a cloud-based Linux image programming in Python, SQL,
and R searching for inefficiencies in the financial markets. If given the chance,
I am confident you will agree that my  prior financial/technology experience,
collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable
candidate for the ``Quant PM" role. \\

  Thanks in advance for your consideration, \\
