\textbf{About Me} \\
Three years ago, I moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to build a family
after the birth of my first child, leaving behind two quantitative investment
firms which I helped build from scratch: 1) PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered
Investment Advisor and 2) Potamus Trading LLC, a SEC Registered
Broker Dealer.

Currently, I manage the publicly-traded portfolio of a large Family
Office to help it meet its financial goals. I've been systematically trading
and researching the public, electronically exchange-traded markets for the
past twelve years. At the moment, I'm working on several projects:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  \textit{Research}: Building portfolio back- and stress-testing infrastructure; adding additional factor, risk-premia strategies
    \item  \textit{Portfolio Management}: Incorporating AI/ML techniques to manage risk and harvest real-time diversification
    \item  \textit{Trading}: Reducing commission/slippage via algorithmic execution; formalizing trade allocation procedures
    \item  \textit{Operations}: Automating pre- and post-trade reporting, settlement, custody, \& clearing
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{Why OCERs?} \\
I was first introduced to ACM while working in Boston.
As a partner of an emerging manager at my prior firm from 2012-2017, I read 
about Aristotle Capital Boston winning the EMM 2017 Manager of the year award.
This peaked my interest, and I paid more attention to OCER's publications in the Wall Street
Journal as well as Barron's. I've agreed with the firm's investment philosophy and
admired the firm's success from afar for several years, so Aristotle's track record
and \$35B in AUM speaks volumes. Most importantly, I believe diversification is not only paramount in investing but is equally important
in corporate culture. At this point in my career, I greatly value working for an established
firm operating under the fiduciary standard that strives itself on honesty, collaboration, integrity,
curiosity, and responsibility while offering growth opportunities to hard working
employees in dynamic environments. As OCERs has proven, the whole can be much greater
than the sum of its parts! \\ 

\textbf{Why Me as an Investment Analyst?} \\
Over the past decade, I've been responsible for trading many types of securities including
Equities, Futures, Options, Treasury/Corporate Bonds, and Alternatives.
I have primarily accessed liquidity by leveraging technology via
systematic execution algorithms across many electronic exchanges and also have experience
trading OTC derivatives and bonds. I've researched, built, executed, cleared/settled
and solicited investments for a multitude of strategies, such as Statistical Arbitrage,
High Frequency Market Making, Tactical Asset Allocation, Global Macro, Smart / Factor Beta,
and Risk Parity.

%Having worked on small teams my entire career alongside amazing mentors and colleagues,
%I have been lucky to learn from and add value to all areas of the investment process,
%from the front to the middle to the back offices. A large part of my professional experience
%has been tied to automating our Beginning-of-Day and End-of-Day operational procedures.
%I'm meticulous and tenacious when it comes to ``crossing the T's and dotting the I's"
%to ensure settlement risk is minimized and clients are treated fairly via robust
%post-trade allocation procedures. \\

Thank you in advance for your consideration. I am confident that my prior ``Fin-Tech"
experience managing institutional capital over the past twelve years, collaborative nature,
and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable member of the OCERs team,
whether it be in a Portfolio Administrator / Trading Assistant or Operations
Associate role (or potentially both!). \\

\closing{
  I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about how I could add
  value to the OCERs Investment Team, \\
