\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I enjoy math, programming,
and solving complex problems. I have hands on experience designing, building,
and maintaining large-scale production systems that have added value across the
investment process including research, portfolio management, execution, and operations.

\textbf{Why Capital Group?} \\
I believe in using technology to improve quality of life, and I've spent many
years avoiding redundant tasks under the philosophy "if it needs to be done more
than once, then automate it". Having successfully used disruptive, quantitative
technologies to change how investors think about, access, and trade their capital
in the financial markets, I desire applying my knowledge and expertise to benefit


\textbf{Why Me?} \\
I am a ``self-starter" who never stops learning and experimenting; I like breaking
stuff and putting it back together. Over the past decade, I have added value
across the entire investment process for a multi-strategy portfolio that spans all
asset classes around the globe. As a result, I have developed relationships with
large, global institutions and have provided custom solutions to a wide spectrum
of investors. I am comfortable working in nearly all operating systems,
but spend most of my time in a cloud-based Linux image programming in Python, SQL, and R.
If given the chance, I am confident you will agree that my  prior financial/technology
experience, collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would make me a
valuable member of the Originate OC team.
