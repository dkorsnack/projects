\textbf{About Me} \\
I recently moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to be closer to family after the
birth of my first child. I've been at PhaseCapital LP, a systematic investment
firm I helped build from the ground up, for nearly a decade. I am an entrepreneurial
and high energy candidate with a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to
detail. I work well with people from various backgrounds, am able to build
relationships easily, am eager to learn, and am adaptable. I am passionate about
using technology to automate and create efficiencies to streamline complicated
processes. I enjoy math, programming, and solving complex problems. I have
hands on experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale production
systems that have added value across the investment process including trading,
operations, portfolio management, and research. \\ 

\textbf{Why T2AM?} \\
I have always believed in applying the scientific method to investing, and I
resonate with T2AM's useage of quantitative, systematic, liquid strategies to harvest
alpha for it's investors. Finding skilled managers/traders in today's marketplace
is extremely difficult; T2AM's experience in quantitative trading gives
unparalleled access to some of the best funds in the world and I greatly admire
the firm's core focus on risk management/portfolio construction. As a newcomer
to the area, I am delighted to see that entrepreneurial, intellectually curious, and
collaborative investment firms like T2AM exist in southern California.  \\

\textbf{Why Me?} \\
Over the past decade, I have added value across the entire investment process
utilizing technology to gain a competitive edge in the financial industry.
I am a ``self-starter" who never stops learning and experimenting; I like breaking
stuff and putting it back together. I am comfortable working in Windows, Macintosh,
and Linux environments, consider myself a ``Microsoft Office Power User", and have
programming experience in several languages. Currently, I spend most of my time
in a cloud-based Linux image programming in Python, SQL, and R. If given the chance,
I am confident you will agree that my  prior financial/technology experience,
collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would make me a valuable
member of the ``\texttt{T3AM}". \\

  Thanks in advance for your consideration, \\
