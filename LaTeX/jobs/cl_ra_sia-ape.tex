\textbf{About Me} \\
Three years ago, I moved from Boston, MA to Irvine, CA to build a family
after the birth of my first child, leaving behind two quantitative investment
firms which I helped build from scratch: 1) PhaseCapital LP, a SEC Registered
Investment Advisor and 2) Potamus Trading LLC, a SEC Registered
Broker Dealer.

Currently, I manage the publicly-traded portfolio of a large Family
Office to help it meet its financial goals. I've been systematically trading
and researching the public, electronically exchange-traded markets for the
past twelve years. At the moment, I'm working on several projects:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Portfolio Management}: Incorporating AI/ML techniques to manage risk and harvest real-time diversification
  \item \textit{Research}: Building portfolio back- and stress-testing engines; adding additional factor, risk-premia strategies
  \item \textit{Operations}: Automating pre- and post-trade reporting, settlement, custody, \& clearing
  \item \textit{Trading}: Reducing commission/slippage via algorithmic execution; formalizing trade allocation procedures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why Research Affiliates?} \\
I admire Research Affiliates for providing up-to-date, cutting-edge financial market research
and creating diversified, well rounded portfolios for investors to easily access
at low cost. (I've also enjoyed the ``healthy debates" between Rob Arnott and Cliff Asness
over the past several years!) I have learned much from Research Affiliates and believe in the
majority of the firm's investment philosophy. Specifically, I've researched, built,
and implemented systematic strategies for institutional quality investors which
are very much in line with Research Affiliate's principles. Most importantly, diversification
is not only paramount in investing but is equally important in corporate culture.
I greatly value working for a firm that strives itself on uniqueness, collaboration,
curiosity, and responsibility; for, I am a true believer that the
whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. \\

\textbf{Why Me as a Strategy Implementation Analyst?} \\
First, I -- along with a amazing mentors and colleagues -- have built, implemented,
and managed several pools of capital with investments from \$20M $\leq$ AUM $\leq$ \$600M
across Market Making, Statistical Arbitrage, Smart Beta, and ``Dynamic Diversification"
strategies for Pensions, Endowments, Family Offices, and Sovereign Wealth Funds.
Second, I've lectured, consulted, and catered to the Asset Allocation
audience for years answering difficult questions such as: Who is the true recipient of
a certain type of investment? What fees are appropriate? What are the key risks? etc.
Lastly, I've dealt with all of the the ``rubber meets the road" implementation details
of applied research including (but not limited to) Execution, Operations, Custody,
Clearing, Reporting, and Allocation. \\

\textbf{Why Me as a Advanced Python Engineer?} \\
I have 12 years of hands-on experience managing fully systematic portfolios
via cloud-based Linux (Ubuntu, Amazon, RedHat) environments primarily built
from open-source Python code fed ``big-data" via causal databases packed with
fundamental and technical information across many frequencies -- e.g., tick
level quote/trade data to quarterly economic projections. More specifically:
\newpage 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Coding:} Python3 (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Cython, Matplotlib, Flask, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, ...)
  \item \textit{Version Control:} Git, Apache Subversion
  \item \textit{Databases:} (Structured) MySQL, Transact-SQL, PostgreSQL; (Unstructured) MongoDB 
  \item \textit{Data APIs:} Bloomberg (Desktop, Terminal, Historic, Real-Time, EMSX), FactSet, Thomson Reuters, RealTick
\end{itemize}

I am confident that my prior ``Fin-Tech" experience managing institutional capital
over the past decade, collaborative nature, and ability to learn quickly would make
me a valuable member of the Research Affiliates team, whether it be in an Analyst
or Engineering (or Both!) role. \\
